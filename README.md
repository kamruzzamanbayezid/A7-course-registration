# Course Registration Project!

Welcome to our programming related courses platform! This platform helps you to improve your programming skills. Below, we provide some essential information on how to select courses.

## Course Selection

You can select one or more courses by following the conditions given below:

1. Browse our courses to find your courses that you want to enroll to improve your skill.

2. Click on the courses you wish to enroll in. You can select multiple courses at once.

3. **View Course Details** :

   - **Course Title**: The name of the selected course.
   - **Price**: The cost of the course.
   - **Credits**: The number of credits associated with the course.

## Enrollment Guidelines

Before enrolling in the course you need to follow some guidelines:

- **Multiple Course Selection**: You can select multiple courses at the same time if you want.

- **No Duplicate Enrollment**: You can select a course only once. You cannot select the same course for the second time..

- **Credit Limit**: Each course has certain credit hours. Here too there is a small condition. You can use maximum 20 credit hours..

## State Management in this Project

In this project, I have used two React hooks. One if them is `useState`.Now I will give a short overview of this `useState`.

### Utilizing State for Course Details

Throughout the project, I have employed `useState` to manage and store specific data related to various courses. Here are a few examples of how I used `useState`:

### 3. Managing Course Titles
The titles of the selected courses are also stored using `useState`. This ensures that the course titles are readily available for display and manipulation within the application.

### 2. Storing Course Prices
I have stored the course prices in a `useState`. When the user enrolls, I have shown the data from `useState` in the UI

### 3. Tracking Total Credits
When a user enrolls in a course, I use `useState` to store credits hours and total used credits hours. This information is updated dynamically and displayed to the user in real-time.

These are some of the ways I have used React's `useState` hook to manage and manipulate the state of the application. For more details on the implementation, please explore the project code.
      

## Get Started

Now that you're familiar with the course selection and enrollment process, you can start building your learning journey with our courses.
